# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design


Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was a design for a web-based application in order to facilitate online training for students looking to take their driver test.  DriverPass identified a void in the market and wanted a way to provide this service.  DriverPass wanted a system which would allow students to take online classes, take practice exams, and reserve on-th-road training.


What did you do particularly well?
I feel that I was successfully able to identify the needs of the client based on the reading and translate the information into a design for a functional system.  I also feel my communication and delivery were clear and made it easy for anyone to interpret.



If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
One thing that I would put more thought into wouuld be the detail of the UML charts.  With so much information to include, the charts can seem a bit overwhelming.  If more time were spent on the construction, the charts would contain all detail without looking overloaded.



How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user's needs were interpreted based on the action required by the system.  There are many users for this system and each of them have different levels of access and control.  It is important to consider user needs when designing because attention needs to be put on access limits and user actions and options.



How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? 
The best way to approach designing software is to communicate effectively with the potential client.  Be upfront and honest and be prepared to answer any questions that may arise.  Collecting detailed information from the client and letting them know how certain parameters are to be met will kickstart a successful design.  Some of the best strategies that I used during this course are the UML charts.  These charts provide a visual representation of the system design which can be easily followed and translated during development.
